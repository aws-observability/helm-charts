# Integration Tests

## Purpose
End-to-end validation of the Helm chart on real Kubernetes clusters. Tests deploy the chart via Terraform, then validate that expected Kubernetes resources (Deployments, DaemonSets, Services, Pods) are created correctly.

## Structure
- `terraform/common/` — Shared infrastructure (IAM roles, VPC, subnets, security groups). Used as a module by EKS and Minikube.
- `terraform/eks/` — Provisions an EKS cluster, node groups, and IAM roles for testing. Has a `windows/` variant for mixed Linux+Windows node groups.
- `terraform/minikube/` — Local Minikube-based test infrastructure with scenario-specific value overrides in `scenarios/`.
- `util/k8sclient.go` — Go wrapper around `k8s.io/client-go` for querying namespaces, pods, services, deployments, daemonsets, webhooks, CRs, and validating resource existence (ServiceAccounts, Roles, ClusterRoles, DaemonSets, Services).
- `validations/eks/` — Go test files validating resource counts and names on EKS. Uses build tags (`linuxonly`, `windowslinux`) to select test variants.
- `validations/minikube/` — Minikube-specific validation with per-scenario test cases.

## Running Tests
Tests require a live cluster. The typical flow:
1. `terraform apply` in the appropriate `terraform/` directory to create infrastructure
2. `go test` with build tags in the `validations/` directory
3. `terraform destroy` to clean up

## Patterns
- Build tags (`//go:build linuxonly || windowslinux`) control which resource counts are expected.
- Resource counts are split into separate files (`resource_counts_linuxonly.go`, `resource_counts_windowslinux.go`) with constants for expected deployments, pods, services, and daemonsets.
- The K8sClient uses `~/.kube/config` — tests assume kubeconfig is already configured for the target cluster.
- Minikube scenarios each have a Terraform directory (`terraform/minikube/scenarios/{name}/`) with `main.tf` + `values.yaml`, and a corresponding Go test file in `validations/minikube/scenarios/`. Scenarios include: default, appsignals-disabled, webhooks-disabled, otlp-disabled, otlp-custom-otel-config, feature-targeted-default, feature-targeted-multi-agent, feature-targeted-otlp-disabled, feature-targeted-custom-otel-config, and others.

### Feature-Targeted Agent Scenarios
These scenarios validate the feature-targeted agent routing architecture where each feature (`containerInsights`, `applicationSignals`, `otelContainerInsights`) declares a `targetAgent` field that controls which agent receives its config.

- **`feature-targeted-default`** — Deploys with default values. Validates that the cluster-scraper CR is rendered as a Deployment-mode agent, all agents have liveness/readiness health probes on port 13133, and OTEL configs are correctly routed (node-level pipelines to `cloudwatch-agent`, cluster-level pipelines to `cloudwatch-agent-cluster-scraper`).
- **`feature-targeted-multi-agent`** — Deploys with multiple agents where `cloudwatch-agent` is targeted by all features and a second agent (`prometheus-agent`) is not targeted by any feature. Validates that `cloudwatch-agent` receives full CI + AppSignals + OTLP CI config while `prometheus-agent` receives only minimal JSON config and health-check-only OTEL config.
- **`feature-targeted-otlp-disabled`** — Deploys with `otelContainerInsights.enabled: false`. Validates that the cluster-scraper CR is not rendered, remaining agents still receive health-check-only OTEL config, and liveness/readiness probes are present unconditionally.
- **`feature-targeted-custom-otel-config`** — Deploys with user-supplied `otelConfig` containing keys that collide with generated config. Validates merge precedence: generated config wins on collision (via `mustMergeOverwrite`), while user-supplied non-colliding keys are preserved in the merged output.

## Pitfalls
- Don't run tests without a live cluster — there are no mocks.
- Minikube scenarios override values via local `values.yaml` files — check the scenario directory before assuming default chart values.
- EKS tests expect specific IAM roles (`cwa-e2e-iam-role`) and VPC resources to exist — these are shared infrastructure, not created by the test Terraform.
